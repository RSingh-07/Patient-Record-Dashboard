## ‚ú® Features Implemented

This dashboard was developed to meet the core requirements of the 'Patient Records Dashboard' task, focusing on modern React best practices.

### 1\. Core Functionality (Patients Page)

  * **Data Handling:** Patient data is fetched from a **hardcoded mock JSON object** to simulate API integration.
  * **Search Bar:** Implemented a real-time filter to allow users to **search patients by name**.
  * **Patient List:** Displays patient records in a **responsive card layout** showing Name, Age, and Contact.
  * **View Details:** Each patient card includes a 'View Details' button that triggers a **Modal** to display complete patient information.

### 2\. Technical Implementation

  * **React Hooks for State Management:** Utilizes `useState` and `useEffect` to manage patient data, search queries, and modal visibility.
  * **Responsive UI/UX (Tailwind CSS):**
      * The entire application is styled with **Tailwind CSS**.
      * The Header implements a **fully functional hamburger menu** that hides the navigation links on mobile and reveals them in a vertical overlay.
      * The main patient list adapts cleanly from a desktop grid to a single-column mobile view.
  * **Bonus Feature:** Includes the ability to open an **'Add New Patient' form** (shown below).
