# üè• Jarurat Care - Patient Records Dashboard

A responsive front-end application built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS** to simulate a patient records management system. This project showcases proficiency in state management using **React Hooks** and utility-first styling for a clean, mobile-friendly user interface.

## ‚ú® Features Implemented

This dashboard was developed to meet the core requirements of the 'Patient Records Dashboard' task, focusing on modern React best practices.

### 1\. Core Functionality (Patients Page)

  * **Data Handling:** Patient data is fetched from a **hardcoded mock JSON object** to simulate API integration.
  * **Search Bar:** Implemented a real-time filter to allow users to **search patients by name**.
  * **Patient List:** Displays patient records in a **responsive card layout** showing Name, Age, and Contact.
  * **View Details:** Each patient card includes a 'View Details' button that triggers a **Modal** to display complete patient information.
  * **Delete Patient** (Bonus): Each patient card features a dedicated 'Delete' button with a confirmation prompt to remove the record from the local state.

Understood. Since you already had the initial features, here is the updated, concise Technical Implementation section, incorporating the Delete functionality and the advanced Hooks (useCallback) we added to your App.jsx.

### üõ†Ô∏è 2. Technical Implementation & Architecture

This project is built using modern React principles, focusing on performance, clear separation of concerns, and a highly responsive user experience.

## Core State & Performance

The application is structured to minimize unnecessary component updates and maintain a clear flow of data.

* **Core State Management:** All data, navigation, and UI states (like search queries and modal visibility) are managed directly using **React Hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`).
* **Architecture Pattern:** The application adheres to the **Container/Presentational Pattern**. The top-level component (`App.jsx`) acts as the **Controller**, housing all state and business logic, which are then passed down via props to pure functional components (Views/Cards).
* **Performance Optimization:** The **`useCallback`** hook is employed in the main container to **memoize all critical handler functions** (`handleAddPatient`, `handleDeletePatient`). This prevents unnecessary re-renders of child components, ensuring fast and smooth interactions.
* **Data Operations:** Full **C.R.U.D. (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** capabilities are implemented directly on the client-side state, featuring user-friendly forms and interaction controls.

---

## Styling, Responsiveness, & Status

The front-end design prioritizes speed and accessibility across all devices.

* **Styling:** Utilizes **Tailwind CSS** for a utility-first approach, enabling rapid development and a professional, maintainable design system.
* **Responsiveness:** The UI is fully adaptive. It includes a functional **Hamburger Menu** for mobile navigation and a patient grid layout that seamlessly scales down to a **single-column view** on smaller screens.
* **Data Status:** Robust **conditional rendering** is implemented to display explicit **Loading** and **Error** states during the simulation of an asynchronous API data fetch, providing clear user feedback.
