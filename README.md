## ‚ú® Features Implemented

This dashboard was developed to meet the core requirements of the 'Patient Records Dashboard' task, focusing on modern React best practices.

### 1\. Core Functionality (Patients Page)

  * **Data Handling:** Patient data is fetched from a **hardcoded mock JSON object** to simulate API integration.
  * **Search Bar:** Implemented a real-time filter to allow users to **search patients by name**.
  * **Patient List:** Displays patient records in a **responsive card layout** showing Name, Age, and Contact.
  * **View Details:** Each patient card includes a 'View Details' button that triggers a **Modal** to display complete patient information.
  * **Delete Patient** (Bonus): Each patient card features a dedicated 'Delete' button with a confirmation prompt to remove the record from the local state.

Understood. Since you already had the initial features, here is the updated, concise Technical Implementation section, incorporating the Delete functionality and the advanced Hooks (useCallback) we added to your App.jsx.

### 2. Technical Implementation üõ†Ô∏è
**State & Architecture**
Core State Management: Uses React Hooks (useState, useEffect) for managing all data, navigation, and UI state (search, modal visibility).

Performance: Employs the useCallback hook in the main container (App.jsx) to memoize all critical handler functions (handleAddPatient, handleDeletePatient), preventing unnecessary re-renders of the component tree.

Architecture: Follows the Container/Presentational Pattern. The top-level component (App.jsx) is the Controller, managing state and logic, which are passed via props to pure functional components (Views/Cards).

Data Operations: Implements full C.R.U.D. capabilities on the client-side state, featuring forms for Add New Patient (Create) and buttons for Delete Patient (Delete).

**Styling & Status**
Styling: Utilizes Tailwind CSS for a utility-first approach, ensuring rapid development and a professional, maintainable design system.

Responsiveness: The UI is fully adaptive, featuring a functional Hamburger Menu for mobile navigation and a patient grid that scales cleanly to a single-column view on small screens.

Data Status: Implements robust conditional rendering to display explicit Loading and Error states during the simulated API fetch, adhering to the bonus requirement.
